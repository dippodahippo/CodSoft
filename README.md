# CodSoft Task Repository

### This repository is intended to contain all the projects completed by me, Diptorshi Tripathi, during my time as an Intern at CodSoft.
## The tasks mentioned are as follows-

Task 1- Movie Genre Classification - A Kaggle dataset is provided, which, in my code, has been analysed using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression- in order to create two separate models that will analyse a sentence and depict what Genre of movie it sounds like.

Task 2- Credit Card Fraud Detection - Two large datasets- fraudTest and fraudTrain can be found from the website, but are too large to upload. They have been analysed using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, and visualized using different plotting techniques, including a confusion matrix. At the end, it also provides a 0/1 output when provided with credit card details.
